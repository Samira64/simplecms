# simplecms
This is a simple application for getting hands dirty with ruby on rails. In this app, we have some admin users who have full access to subjects and can create, edit and delete those subjects and pages and sections related to them. We use session to keep the information about our users. So that, they can easily navigate from one page to another staying recognized by our app.
